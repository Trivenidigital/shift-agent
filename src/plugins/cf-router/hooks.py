"""cf-router hook implementations.

`pre_gateway_dispatch` runs BEFORE the LLM sees the inbound message. We use
this to bypass the LLM entirely for deterministic owner-approval and
menu-decision flows (F8 replacement), to fire alerts on detected sick-call
patterns (F9 replacement), and to schedule a 30s rescue check for missed
catering inquiries (F7 replacement, PR-CF7).

Hook signature (per Hermes gateway/run.py:4197+):
    pre_gateway_dispatch(event, gateway, session_store) -> dict | None

Return value is one of:
    {"action": "skip", "reason": "..."}        — drop message, no LLM call
    {"action": "rewrite", "text": "..."}       — replace event.text, continue
    {"action": "allow"}                         — explicit allow (same as None)
    None                                        — normal dispatch, no override

Multi-plugin: gateway iterates results; first action != "allow" wins.
